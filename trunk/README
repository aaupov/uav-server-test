Server
You shouldn't probably compile or run backend, as it needs local mysql 
server w/appropriate tables and layouts.

Dummy client
(sends some data packed into DCP structs)

how to compile: make client
how to run: (bash script)
for (( i = 11; i < 30; i++ )) do ./dev/uav/bpla_server/client $i; sleep 5; done
./client <num> - num will be used as idx of heartbeat message
