Server

how to compile: clang++ backend.cpp -o backendx -I../rpcp -lmysqlclient
(-I<path> depends on location of rpcp directory), mysqlclient lib is mandatory
how to run: you shouldn't probably run this yourself, as it needs local mysql server w/appropriate tables and layouts

Dummy client
(sends some data packed into DCP structs)

how to compile: clang client.c -o client -I../rpcp
how to run: (bash script)
for (( i = 11; i < 30; i++ )) do ./dev/uav/bpla_server/client $i; sleep 5; done
./client <num> - num will be used as idx of heartbeat message
